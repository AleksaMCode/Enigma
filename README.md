## Name origin
<p align="justify">While learning about history of cryptography and cryptanalysis I've learned more about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine">Enigma machine</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a>. Naturally I choose to name this project Enigma and encrypted files have an extension <code>.at</code>.</p>

## Usage
### Register
<p align="justify">To use the application user first needs to register. User needs to provide an unique <i>Username</i>, <i>Password</i> and his <i><a href="">X.509</a> Public Certificate</i>. Users <i>Username</i>, hashed <i>Password</i> value and his public <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA</a> key extracted from provided certificate will be stored in Enigmas database.<br><br>When registering, user has an option to have his password created for him. The password are generated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator">CSPRNG</a> and are guaranteed to have high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength#Entropy_as_a_measure_of_password_strength">entropy</a>. User can also choose to use a random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passphrase">passphrase</a> generated by Enigma based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware">Diceware</a>.
</p>

### Login
<p align="justify">To use access Enigmas EFS user needs to login. Login process is realizes as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">2FA</a>. At first, user needs to provide <i>Username</i> and <i>Password</i> (something only the user knows). If the entered password matches the hash value stored for the user in the Enigmas database, user will be prompted to provide his certificate (something only the user has). After checking if the given certificate matches the public key stored in the database, certificate is subjected to furter verifications. If the login attempt is successful, user is granted access to EFS.
</p>

#### Login attempt limit
<p align="justify">Every user has a total of three opportunities to enter his password. After three failed attempts, a "nuclear switch" is turned on and users data is deleted.</p>

#### Nuclear switch
<p align="justify">This functionality is implemented to add more security to users files. In addition to deleting user files, users account is locked preventing him to login to Enigmas EFS. Only an admin can unlock an user account. Unlocking process is followed with a mandatory user password change.</p>

## Algorithms
### Symmetric algorithms
List of symmetric encryption algorithms that are implemented in <b>Enigma</b>.
ALGORITHM<br>NAME | BLOCK CIPHER<br>MODE OF OPERATION | KEY SIZE<br>(bits) | BLOCK<br>SIZE (bits)
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a> | <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Electronic_codebook_(ECB)">ECB</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_block_chaining_(CBC)">CBC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_feedback_(CFB)">CFB</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Output_feedback_(OFB)">OFB</a> | 128, 192 and 256 | 128
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camellia_(cipher)">Camellia</a> | ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB | 128, 192 and 256 | 128 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES">3DES</a> | ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB | 192 | 64
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/archives/1998/12/the_twofish_encrypti.html">Twofish</a> | ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB | 128, 192 and 256 | 128
<p align="justify"><b>*</b> I don't recomment ECB mode because it's not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_security">semantically secure</a>. The only time it could be safe to use is if its used for encryption of data smaller than 128 bits when using with AES, Camellia or Twofish, or 64 bits when using 3DES.</p>

### Asymmetric algorithm
RSA cryptosystem is the only asymmetric algorithm implemented. Its used for symmetric key encryption and generating a digital signature of files.

### Hashing algorithms

Algorithm | Variant | Output size<br>(bits)

<p align="justify"><b>*</b> MD5 and SHA1 <b>MUST NOT</b> be used for cryptographic hash functions.</p>

## Passwords and keys
### Password guidelines
<p align="justify">Guidelines for choosing good passwords are typically designed to make passwords harder to discover by intelligent guessing. All the guidelines are NIST compliant. <p>
<ol>
    <li><p align="justify">Memorized secrets are at least 8 characters in length not including spaces.</p></li>
    <li><p align="justify">Password are only required to be changed if there is evidence of compromise.</p></li>
    <li><p align="justify">New passwords are screened against a list of known compromised passwords.</p></li>
    <li><p align="justify">New passwords can't contain username.</p></li>
    <li><p align="justify">Password hints and knowledge-based security questions are not implemented.</p></li>
    <li><p align="justify">Maximum password length is set 200 characters (NIST minimum is 64).</p></li>
    <li><p align="justify">Passwords can contain all printable ASCII characters including a space character.</p></li>
</ol>

### Password Entropy
<p align="justify">For passwords generated by a process that randomly selects a string of symbols of length, L, from a set of N possible symbols, the number of possible passwords can be found by raising the number of symbols to the power L. Increasing either L or N will strengthen the generated password. The strength of a random password as measured by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Shannons</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)">entropy</a> is just the base-2 logarithm of the number of possible passwords, assuming each symbol in the password is produced independently. Random password's information entropy, H, is given by the formula:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="./resources/information_entropy.png" ></p>
<p align="justify">Entropy per symbol for different symbol sets:</p>

SYMBOL SET | SYMBOL<br>COUNT | ENTROPY PER<br>SYMBOL
--- | :---: | ---
Arabic numbers (0-9) | 10 | 3.322 bits
Case insensitive Latin alphabet<br>(a–z or A–Z) | 26 | 4.700 bits
Case insensitive alphanumeric<br>(a–z or A–Z, 0–9) | 36 | 5.170 bits
Case sensitive Latin alphabet<br>(a–z, A–Z) | 52 | 5.700 bits
Case sensitive alphanumeric<br>(a–z, A–Z, 0–9) | 65 | 5.954 bits
All ASCII printable characters | 95 | 6.570 bits
Diceware word list | 7776 | 12.925 bits<br>per word

### Passphrase
<p align="justify"><img src="./resources/xkcd_password_strength.png" width="350" title="xkcd illustration" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5">A passphrase is a sequence of randomly chosen words. It is similar to password in usage, but is generally longer. <b>Enigma</b> offers random generated passphrases based on diceware. While such a collection of words might appear to violate the "not from any dictionary" rule, the security is based entirely on the large number of possible ways to choose from the list of words and not from any secrecy about the words themselves. There are in total 7,776 words in the list (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation">EFF</a> wordlist) and anywhere between 6 and 10 words are chosen randomly which gives us a combination domain of <img src="./resources/diceware_domain.png" title="diceware domain" width="100">, that provides anywhere from 78 to 128 bits of entropy.
Number 7,776 (<img src="./resources/diceware_7776.png" width="65" align="down">) was chosen to allow words to be selected by throwing dice five times.  Every dice throw is simulated by CSPRNG.
As an additional security random delimiter with random length, that varies between 3 and 5 charters (ASCII chars between 0x20 and 0x41), is used.</p>

### Password protection and storage

#### Key streching
<p align="justify">A supplementary approach to frustrating brute-force attacks is to derive the key from the password/passphrase using a deliberately slow hash function. <b>Enigma</b> uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a>.</p>

## Certificate policies
